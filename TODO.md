# TODO:
* Fix config page:
  - Split config page (too long?)
  - Symbols: Strings -> Symbols?
  - Implement symbols selection from alternatives list
* Try to align columns in tooltip (richtext swallows spaces)
* Figure out why it complains about "Setting initial properties failed" on config page
* Figure why console debug log is on by default
